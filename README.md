## Notes on Webscraping
When the local version of Chrome updates, will have to update Chromedriver to compensate.
Download new version of Chromedriver:
    https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads
Unzip and save .exe file in 'Applications'
Disable "Developer Not Verified":
    System Preferences > Security & Privacy > "Allow Anyway"
Running the code will generate a warning. Tell Apple to "Open" and it will now run Chromedriver
